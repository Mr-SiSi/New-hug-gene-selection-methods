Due to the limitation of upload size, the original files cannot be uploaded. However, we put the genome ID here, so you can download from the NCBI dataset (GSM4704934, GSM4704935, GSM4704936, GSM4704937, GSM4704938, GSM4704939, GSM4704940, GSM47049341, GSM4704931, GSM4704932 and GSM4704933).
Featurecounts file is the outcome which has already been calculated by using the algorisms here. It also can be directly seen as RNA seq outcome. Furthermore, to attain the DEGs though different models.
